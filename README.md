# DWA_13.5 Challenge 1: Higher Order Functions

## Complete the following exercises (each with corresponding data)

### Exercise 1

```
const provinces = ['Western Cape', 'Gauteng', 'Northern Cape', 'Eastern Cape', 'KwaZulu-Natal', 'Free State']
const names = ['Ashwin', 'Sibongile', 'Jan-Hendrik', 'Sifso', 'Shailen', 'Frikkie']
```

 - Use ``` forEach ``` to console log each name to the console. You are allowed to call ``` console.log ``` seven times.
 - Use ``` forEach ``` to console log each name with a matching province (for example ``` Ashwin (Western Cape) ```. Note that you are only allowed to call ``` console.log ``` seven times.
 - Using ``` map ``` loop over all province names and turn the string to all uppercase. Log the new array to the console.
 - Create a new array with ``` map ``` that has the amount of characters in each name. The result should be: ``` [6, 9, 11, 5, 8, 7, 7] ```
 - Using ``` toSorted ``` to sort all provinces alphabetically.
 - Use ``` filter ``` to remove all provinces that have the word ``` Cape ``` in them. After filtering the array, return the amount of provinces left. The final value should be 3
 - Create a boolean array by using ``` map ``` and  ``` some ``` to determine whether a name contains an ``` S ``` character. The result should be ``` [true, true, false, true, false, true, false] ```
 - Using only ``` reduce``` , turn the above into an object that indicates the province of an individual. In other words:
```
{
   Ashwin: 'Western Cape',
 	Sibongile: 'Gauteng',
   'Jan-Hendrik': 'Northern Cape',
 	Sifso: 'Eastern Cape',
 	Shailen: 'KwaZulu-Natal',
 	Frikkie: 'Free State',
```

Below are additional exercises. However note that in all the following exercises all code should be written inside the brackets of a single console.log , with the final result being logged to the console. This means that your code will probably look something as follows:
 ```
console.log(
  // Your code here
)
```
